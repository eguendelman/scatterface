# TODO

* host on github pages if possible
* persistent storage (caching) for dataset and uploaded images
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19183180/how-to-save-an-image-to-localstorage-and-display-it-on-the-next-page
* row of buttons at bottom, for refresh, preview target image, etc.
* add credit line and links
* check on mobile devices
* if we create element without adding to DOM does it get garbage collected?

## Ideas for later...

* code refactor, more consistent use of async/then
* gameification - e.g. play a series of images and use timer for scoring
* allow search for multiple people in a single image
* multiuser
* better icon
* additional datasets (e.g. Peppa Pig faces, emoji)
* downselect distractor faces to those that are most similar to the target face ("hard mode")
* nicer background removal (in place of radial gradient)
