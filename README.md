# TODO

* persistent storage (caching) for dataset and uploaded images
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19183180/how-to-save-an-image-to-localstorage-and-display-it-on-the-next-page
* add basic styling or bootstrap
* row of buttons at bottom, for refresh, preview target image, etc.
* add credit line and links
* check on mobile devices
* if we create element without adding to DOM does it get garbage collected?

## Ideas for later...

* additional datasets (e.g. Peppa Pig faces)
* downselect distractor faces to those that are most similar to the target face ("hard mode")
* nicer background removal (in place of radial gradient)
